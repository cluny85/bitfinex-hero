## Get Started

### Install
**not published on npm yet**
```
npm install --save bitfinex-hero
```

## Usage

### Configuration
First thing you need is to pass your Bitfinex API key to create a bitfinex-hero instance. The format of this config looks like:

```javascript
bitfinex: {
  apiKey   : '',
  apiSecret: ''
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** Some functionalities could not work if you don't allow all the permissions when you generate the API key.

### Init
To use this lib, you need to import:

```javascript
const config   = require('../config');
const bitfinex = require('bitfinex-hero');

...

try {
  const bfx = await bitfinex(config);
  const { subscribe, unsubscribe, actions, events } = bfx;
} catch (error) {
}
```

**subscribe, unsubscribe:** To start receiving events, just pass a single callback to the method subscribe:

```javascript
const callback = event => console.log(event);
subscribe(callback);
// to remove the callback listener:
unsubscribe(callback);
```

**subscribe for public events** This is the list of methods you can call to start retreiving information of an specific currency:

- subscribeAllFor(currency): To start receiving events form all the public channels of the currency given.

- subscribeTicker(currency): To start receiving events form Ticker public channel of the currency gived.

- subscribeTrades(currency): To start receiving events form Trades public channel of the currency gived.

- subscribeCandles(currency): To start receiving events form Candles public channel of the currency gived.

- subscribeBook(currency): To start receiving events form OrderBook public channel of the currency gived.

**IMPORTANT:** The currency value has to be a string like this: 'BTCUSD' or 'ETHUSD'

Ie:
```javascript
const { subscribeAllFor } = bfx;
subscribeAllFor('BTCUSD');
```

**actions:** Check the _src/actions_ folder to keep tracking of the actions available. Ie:
```javascript
const order = {
  type  : 'LIMIT',
  symbol: 'BTCUSD',
  amount: 1,
  price : 1
};
actions.order.buy(order);
actions.order.cancel(orderId);
```
